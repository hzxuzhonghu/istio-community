Zhonghu has been contributing to Istio since 2018. Over the last three years, he has collaborated with so many amazing guys to make istio more efficient and stable. He witnessed the prosperity of service mesh and especially aims to make istio the most popular service mesh solution. Being lucky to join istio at the very early stage, he is one of the top contributors of istio and have made totally 7,906 contributions to Istio community since beginning and 2,565 last year. Zhonghu is now a steering committee member and a core maintainer of networking WG, and is more keen on reviewing and helping new users and contributors now.

He is one of the earliest advocates of service mesh Istio in China and organized the first Istio meetup in China. He is also the author of Cloud Native Service Mesh Istio, the best-selling service mesh book in China. And he has also spoken publicly many times about istio.

I am currently focused on istio and have been working in open source for about five years, as a contributor, maintainer or any other roles i want a neutral community. So I want to repeat my last year's word: I want to bring the voice of any user and contributor to steering table and hope to provide neutral mediation to try to solve non-technical disputes, and do the hard work needed to foster an environment which is healthy for contributors, end-users and vendors.
